# kouri v2.0

kouri was a chess AI, programmed in C++.
kouri v2.0 is a work-in-progress multi-game AI (also programmed in C++).

## Authors
kouri is a personal project created by Hunter (a computer engineering student) and Minh (a computer science student).

## Compatibility
The project contains some Windows-specific code and thus, isn't meant to be cross-platform (at the moment). kouri is coded using Visual Studio 2015 on Windows.

## Overview
The plan is for kouri v2.0, once completed, to be able to play multiple games against the user in a smart fashion. 

At this time, kouri is planned to support:
- tic-tac-toe
- chess
- checkers

The development of kouri v2.0 attempts to follow OOP and TDD practices. kouri's AI utilizes the negated mini-max algorithm.
